This web-app is crafted by node.js on server side. I have made this project to practice on concepts like
• fetching json data via http request
• Making request to 3rd-party APIs
• Using handlebars open-source npm module to make dynamic pages
• Using Express.js to make different routes
• Coding cliet-side javascript to access the request made
• Making json http endpoint
• I have used git to gain version control
• Deployment is done using heroku
• I have used SSH rsa keys to securely communicate to github and heroku servers
